# Decision records

A decision record ("ADR", architecture decision record) writes down one decision: what was decided, why, what
else was considered, and what it costs. It is kept so that nobody has to reconstruct the reasoning later from
code, and so that undoing the decision is a choice made knowingly.

## When a record is written, and how it stays true

Since 4 October 2026, at the owner's asking, a record is written with the change that makes the decision, not after
it. (`sv`'s first eleven were each written one to seven days after the decision, and only when a review noticed;
`docs/paper/ADRS.md`.)

- **What needs one.** A change to what counts as evidence or at which tier, to what `sv` runs or connects to, to what it
  writes into someone's folder, to the network fence, a new or removed dependency, a default that changes what a report
  concludes, and every choice the owner makes when a session asks. A change that does none of these needs none.
- **When.** In the same pull request as the decision. For anything substantial, first: the backlog claim adds the
  record as `Status: proposed`, and the pull request that builds it makes it accepted and says where the build
  differs from the plan. A change to an existing decision is a dated "Later" entry on its record, or a new record that
  replaces it; nothing in a record is quietly rewritten.
- **Governs.** Each record lists the files whose change can change its decision. The "Decision records" check
  (`.github/workflows/decision-records.yml`, `tools/adr_check.py`) fails a pull request that touches one of them and
  neither changes the record nor says, on a line of its description, `ADR-0NN: unchanged, because ...` with a reason.
  The reason is the point: it is the moment somebody reads the record against the change.
- **References.** `crates/sv-cli/tests/decision_records.rs` fails when a record names a test or a file that no longer
  exists, governs a pattern that matches nothing, or when any record number cited in the code or the documents has no
  record, or a record is missing from the index below.
- **Required.** The owner decided on 4 October 2026 that "Decision records" is a required check on `main`, so a pull
  request that owes a record does not merge.
- **The weekly review** stays as the safety net: once a week a scheduled session reads every record against the
  week's merged pull requests, and reports how many days each new record came after its decision.

## Numbering

One sequence runs across both versions of SecureVibe, so a number always means one decision.

- **ADR-001 to ADR-014 are v1's.** They moved with v1 to the `v1` branch on 26 September 2026 and are at
  `docs/adr/` there, and at the tags `v1-paper` and `v1-final`. ADR-014 is the file named `ADR-011.md` there,
  whose title calls it ADR-014; v1 has no other file for either number.
- **ADR-015 onward are `sv`'s**, and are here.

## v1's records that `sv` still cites

Two of v1's decisions are rules `sv` keeps. `DESIGN.md` restates both among "the rules that carry over" (the
evidence-tier rule without its number), and ADR-012 is also cited by number in `DESIGN.md`, in three source files, and in two tests:

- **ADR-006, evidence tiers.** AI review alone is never a pass, and a requirement only a person can check
  never passes on its own.
- **ADR-012, what "SecureVibe checks this app" means in another language.** Written after the first app from
  outside, a Python one, was told it was missing `package-lock.json`. `sv` cites it for the rule it drew from
  that incident: a check that does not apply is not a check that failed, a scan that did not run is not a
  clean result, and a wrong statement in a report is worse than a gap in it.

  ADR-012 also ruled out SecureVibe writing its own static-analysis rules for other languages. `sv` later
  wrote such rules for fourteen languages, fifteen counting shell on 30 September 2026 (`DESIGN.md`, "Rules
  that read the code"). ADR-018 replaces that ruling, and the rest of ADR-012 stays in force.

| [ADR-086](ADR-086.md) | The observability dashboard adds five things to `sv dashboard`, as the owner chose on 11 October 2026 (proposed) |

## Where v1's records disagree with what v1 built

v1's records are archived on the `v1` branch and are not edited; the owner chose on 30 September 2026 to record
their corrections here instead (BACKLOG, "Records that disagree with what was built"). Each was checked against
the `v1` branch and its history on that day.

- **ADR-001** cites V15.1.2 (keep an inventory of third-party components) for choosing "TypeScript everywhere
  with a single npm install". A language choice is not an inventory; ADR-007, which ships the inventory, cites
  the same requirement correctly. For `sv`, ADR-020 replaces this record's choice.
- **ADR-008** lists three AI providers: `anthropic`, `null`, and `scripted`. OpenAI and Google providers were added
  on 18 September 2026 (`7ecb4c3`, `71fae08`), with a choice of service for each step (`4b947ac`), and the record
  was not updated.
- **ADR-010** says generated code's network access is not restricted, and lists macOS `sandbox-exec` among the
  alternatives set aside. On 18 September 2026, two days after it was accepted, v1 fenced the network of the code
  it ran (`27b85e2`, `pipeline/net-fence.ts`): loopback only, through `sandbox-exec` on macOS and a network
  namespace on Linux, as v1's `docs/CONTRACTS.md` describes. The record was not updated, and v1's `README.md`
  still says "Network access is **not** restricted". For `sv`, ADR-019 replaces this record's choice.
- **ADR-012** cites "ADR-011's sibling change". No record carries the number ADR-011 (the file named `ADR-011.md`
  is ADR-014, as above). The change it means is `dca2e6c`, "Say what was read, and stop scoring code nobody read".
- **ADR-013** says its PDF writer "lays it out on A4 pages", and its consequences, updated by `2ef4149`, say the
  paper size is a setting with US Letter the default and A4 the other choice. The consequences are what v1 does.
