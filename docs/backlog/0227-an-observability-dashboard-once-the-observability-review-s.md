# An observability dashboard, once the observability review's findings are built

**Status:** claimed by build-0227, 10 October 2026

Asked for by the owner on 9 October 2026, after the observability review (0226): "please add to the backlog an item
to work on an observability dashboard once this work is complete". **Not to be taken before 0226's findings are
built**: parts 1 and 2, and the owner's decisions A (ADR-082), C (ADR-083), and D (ADR-084). It reads the records
those make, and before them there is little to show.

A page, private to the owner and written to their own computer like the dashboard of ADR-057 (`sv dashboard`), that
shows what `sv` did and why, across runs and apps, from `sv`'s own records only. Among what it could show, to be
settled with the owner, with a mock-up first:

- **Each run:** when it ran, with which `sv` and which data, how long each part took, which outside tools ran and their
  versions, what could not run and why, and whether it finished, failed, or was stopped.
- **Each requirement over time:** its status run by run, and what moved it (a check, a finding, a note, a setting).
- **The running app:** for a run with the app, the probes' exchanges and the stand-in services' records (ADR-082),
  beside the credits and findings that rest on them.
- **The build loop:** the AI coding tool's calls, their outcomes, the prompts and report files it was given, and the
  findings fixed, set aside, and new between its checks (ADR-084).
- **`sv`'s own health:** crashes, data files that did not load, records it could not read.

Whether it extends `sv dashboard` or is a page of its own is part of the plan. It opens no network connection, keeps
everything on the owner's computer, and adds no record of its own beyond what ADR-057, 082, 083, and 084 decide; a page
that would need more is the owner's decision.

**Later, 9 October 2026, at the owner's word:** the overview of the backlog belongs here too ("this can be part of the
dashboard work whenever we get to that"): each item with its numbered parts under it, from the parts' own status lines
that 0228 adds, with who holds what and what is open, in place of the board in the documentation set, which guessed
the parts from their prose.
