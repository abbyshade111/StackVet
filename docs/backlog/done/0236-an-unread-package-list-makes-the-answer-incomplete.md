# An unread package list makes the answer incomplete (observability review, part 3, H)

**Status:** done, 10 October 2026

The owner's word, 10 October 2026, asked with the three other open decisions of that day: yes (part 3, H, of backlog 0226; part 1, item 11 there, which asks for a fixture first).

A package list `sv` could not read makes the answer about which libraries the app uses incomplete, not "not used":
technology detection counts absence as evidence by default (`absence_is_evidence`, `crates/sv-scan/src/lib.rs`).
First a fixture showing the wrong answer reaching a report; then the answer marked incomplete wherever an unread list
could have changed it. Changes what counts as evidence, so its record is written with the build. Small to medium.

**Built 10 October 2026:** the absence answer for a technology that is looked for by its package is incomplete, not "not used", while a package list `sv` could not read is present (`crates/sv-scan/src/lib.rs`). The fixture that showed the wrong answer (`crates/sv-scan/tests/unread_manifests.rs`) now asserts the incomplete answer and that it names the file.
