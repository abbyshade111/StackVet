# Every session: list what you have made that could be deleted, and ask the owner

**Status:** done, 10 October 2026

Asked by the owner on
7 October 2026, after the disk reached 152 MB free during the revision trial (17 GB was freed by deleting one session's
own `cargo` build folders, with the owner's yes). Each session, the cloud ones included where they keep files on this
Mac, looks through what it made: `cargo` target folders, worktrees under `/tmp/claude-502` and elsewhere, trial
folders under `~` (such as `~/sv-loop`, `~/sv-prompts`) whose results are committed, and logs. It writes the list
under this item, one line each, with the size, whether it can be made again, and which session made it, then asks
the owner. Nothing is deleted without the owner's yes; a folder another session made is that session's to list.
The standing rule is in `CLAUDE.md` ("Keep the disk tidy").
- Session securevibe-e2 (7 October 2026): a cloud session, so nothing of its own is on the Mac. Its build folder
  and scratch files are in its own cloud container, which is removed when the session ends.

**Branches, 10 October 2026, session securevibe-e2.** Asked with the other open decisions that day, the owner said
to delete the remote branches already in `main` ("please go ahead and delete based on your recommendation"): 274 of
them (259 merged, 16 reached `main` by cherry-pick or rebase, less this session's own designated branch, which
stays), each checked again against `main` just before. Kept: `v1`, the archive, and 29 holding commits `main` does
not have. The session's GitHub proxy refuses deleting a branch (HTTP 403, by `git push --delete` and by the API), so
nothing was deleted from the session; the owner was given a script that checks each branch again and deletes it from
the owner's own clone.
**Decided by the owner, 10 October 2026:** the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md` is the deliverable. The per-session listing and the branch-deletion script stay outside the backlog.
