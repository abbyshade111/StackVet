//! What to ask a running app, and what its answers mean.
//!
//! Deliberately split from the thing that makes the requests. This file decides what to ask and how to
//! read the reply; `sv-run` knows about containers and networks. That way the judgment is testable
//! against recorded responses without Docker, which is most of it.
//!
//! # These probes sign in as nobody
//!
//! Every request here is made by somebody who has not logged in, because `sv` does not know how to log
//! in to an app it did not write. v1 seeds users and probes as them; doing that for an arbitrary app
//! means the manifest saying how, which is its own piece of work.
//!
//! The consequence is stated rather than hidden: authorization, session handling and anything behind a
//! login are **not assessed**, and `unassessed_requirements` names them. A probe suite that quietly
//! covers only the front door, and reports nothing, reads exactly like one that found nothing wrong.
