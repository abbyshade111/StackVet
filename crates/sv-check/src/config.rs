//! Configuration checks: the things that are wrong about an app's setup rather than its code.
//!
//! These are the checks that survive being language-agnostic. v1 has nineteen, and most are about its own
//! template — whether `package.json` was modified, whether the session policy matches the profile, whether
//! `trust proxy` is set to the right number of hops. Those mean nothing for an app somebody else wrote.
//! What is left is small and universal, and one of it matters more than everything in `secrets.rs`:
//!
//! **A credential in a file is a problem. A credential in version control is a different problem**, because
//! history keeps it after the file is fixed, and every clone, fork and backup has a copy. `sv check` can
//! find a key in `.env`; only git can say whether `.env` was committed.
//!
//! Every check here reports one of three things, never two. It passed, it failed, or **it could not be
//! run** — and the third is a first-class answer with a reason attached, because a check that did not run
//! is not a check that passed. Asking git about a folder that is not a repository is the ordinary case for
//! an app somebody uploaded, not an error.
