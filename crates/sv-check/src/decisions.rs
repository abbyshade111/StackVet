//! `design-decisions.md`: the decisions the design-time prompts write down before the code.
//!
//! Four of the prompts in `data/design-prompts.json` write a section of this file, each under a
//! heading of its own words and no requirement id. Two of them count toward a Secure by Design
//! checklist control and are read through `crate::notes`, with the catalog in
//! `data/design-decisions.json`: "What we do if something goes wrong" (SBD-MT-06) and "Rules that
//! might apply" (SBD-AC-06). The other two count toward nothing and are read here:
//!
//! - **"When to bring in a person"** says whether the app needs a person's security review as well
//!   as `sv`'s checks. Its words are repeated in the report, where what was not examined is listed,
//!   since no tool can make that review; `sv` does not decide what they recommend, and credits
//!   nothing for them.
//! - **"Safe defaults"** lists every feature and switch the app has and what was turned off. Three
//!   of its lines have a fixed form, each a switch a check of the running app can see:
//!   `- debug mode: off`, `- cross-site access: own site only`, and `- default accounts: none`.
//!   A switch decided the safe way that the check finds the other way is a finding of its own,
//!   *decided, not held to* (`decisions.not-held-to`), beside the check's. Nothing is credited for
//!   a decision the check agrees with: the check's own credit already says what it saw. The rest of
//!   the section is for a person.
//!
//! The owner's decisions of 5 October 2026 (BACKLOG, design-time item 9).
