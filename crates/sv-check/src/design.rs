//! The design questions: how the app is built, answered by the only person who knows.
//!
//! Sixteen requirements at level 1 and 2 ask for a property of the design rather than a fact in the
//! code — is validation enforced on the server, are the app's own services authenticated to each
//! other, can a load balancer's headers be faked by a browser. A scanner can sometimes see a
//! fragment of one and never the whole, so they sat in the report as *not verified* beside the
//! requirements nobody had looked at.
//!
//! The owner answers them in stackvet.toml, as `yes`, `no`, `not-sure`, or `planned`, with `where`
//! naming the file that does it.
//!
//! # Why this tier is weaker than the notes, and how much weaker
//!
//! The security notes credit requirements that ask for a *document*: writing the document is the
//! thing ASVS asks for, so writing it partly satisfies the requirement. Nothing of the kind is true
//! here. V8.3.1 asks that authorization be enforced at a trusted service layer; an owner writing
//! "yes" has not enforced anything. The answer is worth recording — it is a decision, and `where`
//! points somebody at the code — but it is **the owner's word about the app, not the app**.
//!
//! So *attested by the owner* ranks below *documented by the owner*, and two things follow that the
//! tier would be dishonest without:
//!
//! - **An attested requirement is still a test to write.** Every other tier that is not *checked*
//!   stays on that list, and this one must too: an attestation is precisely the claim a test would
//!   settle. Dropping it off the list would let an attestation quietly retire the work of proving it.
//! - **An attestation settles no threat**, for the same reason a document does not, only more so.
//!
//! # The answers that are findings
//!
//! Two of them, and they are what make this worth building rather than a way to feel better about a
//! report:
//!
//! - **`no`** — the owner has said the control is not there. That is the requirement failing, on the
//!   best authority available, and it belongs in the report as *needs attention* rather than as a
//!   silent nothing.
//! - **A `where` that names a file the app does not have** — a pointer that has gone stale, which is
//!   worse than no pointer: it reads as evidence and leads nowhere. The attestation is withheld and
//!   the staleness is reported.
//!
//! # `planned`: decided before there is code, then held to
//!
//! Since 5 October 2026 (backlog item 5 of the design-time list, the owner's decision): a decision
//! made before the code is written has no file to point to yet, and `yes` would be a claim about
//! code that does not exist. So `planned`, with `where` naming the file it will be in. It credits
//! nothing, ever; what it is worth depends on whether the app has code yet:
//!
//! - **No code yet** (the scan read no source file and no dependency manifest): it is listed as
//!   planned, not built yet. That is the honest state of a brief, and not a gap in the app.
//! - **Code, and the named file is not there**: a finding, *decided, never built*. Low, like the
//!   stale pointer it resembles, and less certain, because the work may be in another file.
//! - **Code, and the named file is there**: still nothing credited. The decision may be built now,
//!   and the answer should say so: `yes` if it is, `no` if it is not.
//! - **Code, and no `where`**: nothing to look for, so `sv` says it cannot tell whether it was built.
//!
//! # The AI coding tool's answers, one tier lower
//!
//! The tool that wrote the app knows its code better than a non-programmer owner does, so it is
//! asked these questions too (`sv mcp`). Its `yes` is the author grading its own work, so it gets
//! its own tier, *stated by the AI coding tool*, below the owner's word, with everything above
//! holding for it as well: still a test to write, no threat settled, and `no` still a finding. An
//! answer that does not say who gave it is counted as the tool's: the file is usually written by the
//! tool, and crediting the owner on nobody's say-so is the direction that overstates.
//!
//! # The owner's answers are the ones recorded through `sv review`
//!
//! Since 4 October 2026 (deep review R1, the owner's decision): `by = "owner"` is one line the AI
//! coding tool can write as easily as the owner, so an answer counts as the owner's only when
//! `sv review` recorded it and sealed it (`crate::seal`). Any other `by = "owner"` counts as the
//! tool's word, one tier down, and the report says why and how to make it the owner's.
