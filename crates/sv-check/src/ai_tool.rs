//! The AI coding tool's own files in the project folder (ADR-049).
//!
//! The person using `sv` builds with an AI coding tool, and the tool keeps files of its own in the
//! folder: settings that run commands, permissions that let it act without asking, the MCP servers
//! it starts, and instruction files it reads as orders. None of them is the app, so nothing here
//! counts toward the app's grade. Three things are read:
//!
//! - **What the tool's settings let it do** (`read`): each command a setting runs, each address its
//!   traffic is sent to, each permission that lets it act without asking, and each MCP server it
//!   starts. These are notes for the report's own section, never findings: the person may have
//!   chosen any of them, and they are about the person's computer. Each format is read from the
//!   tool's own documentation. A setting that documentation says has no effect from a project file
//!   is not noted.
//! - **Characters hidden in its instruction files** (`hidden_characters`): Unicode tag characters
//!   and the controls that override the direction of text, which a person reading the file cannot
//!   see and the tool reads. Only ever a finding, citing no requirement.
//! - **`sv`'s own marks named in its instruction files** (`marks_named`): `Written by: owner`,
//!   `by = "owner"`, `[[finding-review]]`, `not-the-app`, `Sealed by sv review`. A line naming one may
//!   tell the tool to write a mark that is the owner's alone, or tell it never to, so it is a note for
//!   the owner to read, never a finding.
//!
//! OWASP's Agentic Skills Top 10 names these risks (`docs/AGENTIC-SKILLS-TOP-10.md`); it is not a
//! framework `sv` cites, so a note says which of its risks it speaks to in words only.
