//! What the app's own output recorded about the things the probes did to it (V16.3.1, V16.3.2).
//!
//! # Why this can credit and never fault
//!
//! The only output `sv` can see is the container's: whatever the app wrote to stdout and stderr.
//! An app that logs to a file, to syslog, or to a logging service writes nothing there, and is not
//! logging any less for it. So finding the events is evidence that they are logged, and *not*
//! finding them is evidence of nothing at all — reported as not assessed, never as a finding.
//!
//! This is the opposite shape from most checks here, which can only ever fault. It is the same
//! reasoning either way: say only what was actually shown.
//!
//! # Why the probes plant markers
//!
//! "The log mentions `admin`" says nothing — every log mentions `admin`. So the probes do things
//! no other traffic could have done, each carrying a string nothing else in the world contains, and
//! the check looks for those strings:
//!
//! - a sign-in attempt for an account that does not exist, so its name can only appear in the log
//!   because a *failed* authentication was recorded;
//! - a sign-in that succeeded, by an account used for nothing else, so its name can only appear
//!   because a *successful* one was;
//! - a request to a private page, made by nobody, carrying a marker in its address.
//!
//! V16.3.1 asks for both successful and unsuccessful authentication, so it is credited only when
//! both are found. One of the two is not the requirement, and would be the kind of half-credit
//! this project exists to refuse.
//!
//! # Markers that are not personal data
//!
//! The accounts' names are email addresses, and an app that follows the usual privacy rules —
//! never log an email address, never log what follows `?` in an address — writes neither
//! the names nor a marker after `?`. Its log is the one `sv`'s own design prompt asks for, and it
//! must not be what blinds this check. So each event also carries a marker in a request *path*,
//! which such an app does log:
//!
//! - **The sign-ins are bracketed.** Just before each of the two sign-ins, `sv` asks for a page
//!   nobody has, `/sv-log-before-…`, and just after it `/sv-log-after-…`. Those requests mean
//!   nothing to the app (a 404, usually) and carry nothing personal. A line written between the two
//!   was written while that one sign-in was being handled, and if it names a sign-in event
//!   (`login_failed`, `user.signin`, `authentication failed`) it is the record of it. The
//!   sign-in's own address is taken out of each line before the words are read, so an access log
//!   line `POST /login 401` does not count as an event on the strength of its path. The failed
//!   sign-in's line must also say it failed; the successful one's must not.
//! - **The refused request is asked twice.** Once as before, the private page itself with the
//!   marker after `?`, so its meaning is untouched. And once with the marker as a last path part
//!   under the private page (`/account/sv-log-denied-…`), which an app logs even when it strips
//!   query strings. That second address is not the private page, so its answer is only evidence of
//!   a refusal when it is the same refusal the private page got, and not a 404: an app that
//!   guards everything under `/account` sends both to the sign-in page alike, while an app that
//!   answers "no such page" was never asked an authorization question.
//!
//! The bracketing rests on the app writing its lines in the order it handles requests, which is
//! true of an app writing to one stream, or flushing each line, as logging libraries do. It is
//! also why a line found this way never stands for *who*: it is tied to the request by when it was
//! written, not by what it says.
