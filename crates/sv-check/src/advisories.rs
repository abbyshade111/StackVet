//! Matching the bill of materials against known vulnerabilities.
//!
//! # `sv` does not fetch anything
//!
//! This reads a local OSV database the owner points it at, and never opens a network connection. That is
//! a deliberate decision rather than an unfinished one, for three reasons:
//!
//! * **Checking code is not a reason to phone home.** The list of packages an app depends on is
//!   business-confidential, and sending it to a service to be checked is a disclosure the owner did not
//!   ask for. v1 fences generated code to loopback for the same reason.
//! * **A fetch is a dependency on somebody else's uptime.** A check that silently degrades when a
//!   service is slow is a check that reports a clean result on a bad day.
//! * **`sv` runs where there may be no network at all** — an air-gapped review, a CI runner with egress
//!   rules, somebody's laptop on a train.
//!
//! Getting the data is therefore the owner's step, done deliberately and visible in their shell history:
//! OSV publishes per-ecosystem zip exports, and `sv audit --advisories <dir>` reads what they unpacked.
//!
//! # No data is not a clean result
//!
//! The rule this module exists under. With no advisory directory, `audit` reports **not assessed** and
//! says what to do about it. It never prints "no known vulnerabilities", because that sentence would be
//! true of an empty directory, a stale one, and a healthy app alike, and only one of those is good news.
//! The same applies per-ecosystem: advisories for npm say nothing about the Python packages beside them.

    // looks like. It is kept as the statement of intent — the claim is about what was compared
    // against, and that must never be nothing — and labeled rather than left to look load-bearing.
    // The test asserts the behavior, not which condition produced it.
    //
    // A second lockfile nobody read is the same wrong question from the other side: every package
    // in the list was compared, and the list may not be what the app is installed from.
    //
    // A manifest that asks for other versions than its lockfile has is the same again: the list
    // describes the lockfile, and whoever installs from the manifest runs something else.
