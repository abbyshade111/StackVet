//! An app's AI feature, asked through a test model of `sv`'s own.
//!
//! The run points the app at a model that runs on the fenced network (`sv-run`'s
//! `assets/model-provider.mjs`) instead of the real service. It answers in the shapes the real
//! services use, costs nothing, and does on purpose what a model can be talked into doing: repeat
//! its instructions, name an image on another server. What is judged is the **app's** controls,
//! which are the part a small app owns: whether a reply carrying the instructions reaches the page
//! (C7.3.2), whether an address the model names gets fetched (C7.3.3), whether each request limits
//! how long the reply may be (C7.1.2), and whether a textbook prompt injection reaches the model at
//! all (C2.1.3). The model's own robustness is not asked; a model that stands in for another says
//! nothing about it.
//!
//! Every message carries `SV-PROBE-<KIND>-<tag>`, and the test model is asked afterwards what
//! arrived for that tag. The setup is shown first: a plain message has to reach the model, or
//! nothing else is judged.
