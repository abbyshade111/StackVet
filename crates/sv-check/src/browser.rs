//! Checks made in a real browser, signed in as the first test user.
//!
//! Some questions have an answer only once a page is drawn: whether a sign-out control that is in
//! the HTML can actually be seen (V7.4.4), and whether text somebody typed is shown as text or drawn
//! as markup and run (V3.2.2). A request and its response cannot tell; a browser can. The run starts
//! a headless Chromium on the fenced network when stackvet.toml has `[stack.run.users.browser]`,
//! and this module says what to do in it and what the answers mean.
//!
//! Nothing is credited unless the browser was really signed in: each private page has to open in it
//! as it did for the plain requests, or the checks here say why they were not made.
