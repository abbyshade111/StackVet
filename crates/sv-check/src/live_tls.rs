//! Two more questions about the live site, beside `production.rs`: whether its DNS offers Encrypted
//! Client Hello (V12.1.5), and whether its name is on the HSTS preload list (V3.7.4).
//!
//! Neither sends the site anything. The DNS question goes to this computer's own resolver, as any
//! browser's would. The preload list is never fetched: it is a file the owner downloaded on
//! purpose, exactly as the advisory database is, because looking a name up in somebody else's
//! service tells that service which site is being checked.
