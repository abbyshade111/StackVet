//! What a check found, and what it is evidence about.
//!
//! Two things are deliberate here and both come from v1's rules.
//!
//! **A secret never travels in a finding.** `Secret` cannot be constructed with the value visible: it
//! redacts on the way in, and there is no accessor that gives the original back. A finding is written to
//! reports, logs and SARIF, and a scanner that reports a credential has copied it somewhere new.
//!
//! **A check that knows which requirements it verifies says so.** `requirement_ids` is not decoration: it
//! is the link between "this rule fired" and "this ASVS requirement has evidence about it". A finding with
//! an empty list is evidence about nothing in particular, which is a fair thing to be, but it has to be
//! visible rather than assumed.
