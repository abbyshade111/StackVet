//! What the app's own tests are evidence about.
//!
//! The largest untapped source of positive evidence here, and the easiest place in the whole
//! workspace to overclaim — so the rule is narrow and stated once: **a test counts only for a
//! requirement it names, and only when the suite it belongs to actually passed.**
//!
//! Everything else that suggests itself is guessing. A test called `test_login` might be about
//! authentication requirements, or session requirements, or neither; matching it to a requirement by
//! its words would credit a requirement on the strength of a name somebody chose for other reasons.
//! `sv init` therefore asks the app's author to write the requirement id into the test, and this
//! reads that back. A test that names nothing is not evidence about anything in particular, which is
//! a fair thing for a test to be.
//!
//! Three things have to hold before a single requirement is credited:
//!
//! 1. **The suite ran and passed.** A failing suite says nothing about any requirement in it — not
//!    even the tests that passed, because `sv` sees one exit code and not which tests it came from.
//! 2. **The id is a real requirement.** An id that resolves to nothing is a typo, and crediting it
//!    would put a green line against a requirement that does not exist.
//! 3. **The id appears in a test file.** A requirement named in a comment in the application code is
//!    somebody's note, not a test.
//!
//! The one thing this cannot check is whether the test actually tests what it names. v1 compares the
//! test's wording with the requirement's and reports where they share nothing; about a third of those
//! flags are honest tests phrased differently, so it reports and never withholds credit. The same
//! choice is made here, for the same reason: a check that withholds credit on a third of honest work
//! is a check people turn off.
