//! Rules that read the code itself, rather than the text of it.
//!
//! Everything else in `sv-check` works on strings. That is right for credentials, where the thing being
//! looked for *is* a string, and wrong for "is this SQL built by pasting a variable into it", where a
//! regex either misses the case split over two lines or fires on the word `execute` in a comment.
//!
//! So this parses. tree-sitter was taken as a dependency where a YAML crate was not, for the reason that
//! decides these: there is no honest hand-rolled alternative to a parser, it is actively maintained, and
//! four grammars build in about four seconds.
//!
//! # Queries are data, judgment is code
//!
//! `data/ast-rules.json` holds a tree-sitter query per language, so teaching a rule about Ruby is a data
//! entry. What a query cannot express is judgment — "the argument is a literal, so this `eval` is ugly
//! rather than dangerous" — and that lives here, in Rust, where it can be tested. It is the same split
//! as the secrets scanner: patterns as data, the decision about what they mean as code.
//!
//! # A language with no grammar is a language not read
//!
//! `sv-scan` counts more languages than this module can parse. A language with no grammar compiled in
//! is not scanned, and that is reported rather than left to look like a clean result, the same way the
//! secrets scanner reports the files it skipped. Ruby, then C#, then C++ were the standing example of
//! this in turn, each until it got a grammar; Objective-C is the one the tests below use now, so the
//! case stays exercised rather than becoming untestable the day the list is empty.
