//! Finding credentials that were left in the code.
//!
//! Two kinds of rule, and the split is the point. The **pattern** rules live in
//! `data/secret-rules.json` because a well-known credential format is data: adding Azure or Twilio should
//! be a data-file entry, not a Rust change. The **judgment** rules are Rust, because deciding whether a
//! high-entropy string is a credential or a content hash is not something a regex can do.
//!
//! What stops this being noise:
//!
//! * A placeholder is not a secret. `your-api-key-here`, `changeme`, `${SOMETHING}` and an empty value are
//!   what a template looks like, and reporting them teaches an owner to ignore the scanner.
//! * `.env` is *expected* to hold real, high-entropy credentials, so the judgment rules do not run there.
//!   What matters about `.env` is whether it is committed, which is its own rule.
//! * Nothing that did not get read is reported as clean. The caller is told which files were skipped.
