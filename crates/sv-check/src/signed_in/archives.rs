//! V5.2.3: compressed files sent to the upload, to the limits the owner states (ADR-046).
//!
//! The owner says which formats the app unpacks (`unpacks-archives`), the most one may unpack to
//! (`max-unpacked-bytes`), and the most files one may hold (`max-files`). For each format listed,
//! an ordinary small archive goes first, to show the upload takes that format at all; then one
//! that unpacks to just over the stated most, and, for zip, one holding one file more than the
//! stated most. Refused is credited when an ordinary file sent straight after is accepted; taken is
//! a finding, since the owner says the app unpacks it; a crash is held back by the run's own rule
//! for refusals (`RESTS_ON_A_REFUSAL`).
//!
//! The archives are written here, with no library: what unpacks to a great deal is a run of zeros,
//! and a run of zeros compresses to a few lines of code.
