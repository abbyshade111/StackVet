//! A record's owner taken from the request that creates it (mass assignment beyond sign-up; the gap
//! analysis of 7 October 2026, finding 13(a)).
//!
//! When the record the first user reads back names its owner (`"user_id": 7`), the second user
//! creates two records: one as stackvet.toml says, and one with that owner field set to the first
//! user's value. The second record shown to the first user as theirs, while the plain one is not, is
//! the owner taken from the request. Only ever a finding: an app that ignores seven guessed field
//! names may take an eighth.
