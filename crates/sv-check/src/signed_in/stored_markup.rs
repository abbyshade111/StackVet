//! A saved record written back into a page unencoded: stored cross-site scripting, asked without a
//! browser (the gap analysis of 7 October 2026, finding 13(b), the stored record's half).
//!
//! The first user saves a second `owned` record whose text carries `<"'` between the marks the
//! reflection probes use, then opens the record and the pages that list it. An HTML page with the
//! `<` as it is between the marks is the finding. The marks are the reflection probes' own so the
//! runner keeps the text around them however long the page is.
