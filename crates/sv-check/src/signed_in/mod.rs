//! What a signed-in user can do, asked of the running app.
//!
//! The probes in `probes.rs` sign in as nobody, so authorization, sessions and request forgery were
//! always *not assessed*. This asks as two ordinary users, A and B — and an admin, when the app's
//! `seed` command makes one — using what `[stack.run.users]` in stackvet.toml says about how to sign
//! up, sign in and out, and which pages and records belong to whom.
//!
//! # Every check establishes its own setup first
//!
//! A test whose setup can fail quietly is worse than no test: B being refused A's note proves nothing
//! if A could not read it either, and "logout ended the session" proves nothing if the session never
//! worked. So each check first shows the thing it relies on — A's session reaches a private page, A
//! can read what A created, the admin can open the admin page — and when it cannot, the check reports
//! *not assessed* with the reason, never a pass.
//!
//! # Judgment here, requests elsewhere
//!
//! Like `probes.rs`, this decides what to ask and how to read the answers; it talks to the app only
//! through [`Http`]. `sv-run` supplies one that speaks from inside the network fence, and the tests
//! supply a scripted app with each flaw switchable, which is how every rule here is shown to fire.
//!
//! # Where each check lives
//!
//! This file holds what every check shares: sessions and cookies, anti-forgery tokens, requests
//! filled from stackvet.toml's templates, signing in and up, and `run_with`, which calls each
//! area's checks in turn. The rules each check can raise are in `rules.rs`. The checks themselves:
//!
//! - `signin.rs`: wrong-password limits (V6.3.1), `X-Forwarded-For`, default accounts, a password in
//!   an address, and signing out.
//! - `sessions.rs`: session cookies, ids, and timeouts, invented sessions, private pages and their
//!   caching, `Clear-Site-Data`, the fields a record gives back, and a private WebSocket's session
//!   and origin.
//! - `passwords.rs`: the password rules at sign-up (short, common, breached, context words, altered,
//!   long), the password field, changing a password, hints, and deleting an account.
//! - `reset.rs`: a forgotten-password reset, followed through the email it sends.
//! - `codes.rs`: signing in with an emailed code, and what the three email flows share for finding a
//!   code in an email.
//! - `activation.rs`: the activation code emailed at sign-up.
//! - `totp.rs`: two-factor codes from an authenticator app.
//! - `admin.rs`: the admin page and admin actions, a role given at sign-up, and records that belong
//!   to someone else.
//! - `forgery.rs`: cross-site request forgery, `Origin: null`, and forms another site can send
//!   without a preflight. The WebSocket origin check's tests are here too, beside the other origin
//!   tests; the check itself is in `sessions.rs`.
//! - `flows.rs`: steps of a multi-step flow taken out of order.
//! - `uploads.rs`: uploads and downloads.
//!
//! Each file's tests sit beside its checks. The tests here are the ones that exercise several areas
//! at once, and `fake_app.rs` is the scripted app they all drive.
