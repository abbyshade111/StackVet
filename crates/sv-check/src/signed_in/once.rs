//! An action that should go through only once, sent many times at the same instant (V2.3.4).
//!
//! The owner names it in `once`: booking the last seat, redeeming a one-time code. Two test users,
//! A and B, each read the page's token once, and then the request goes out `AT_ONCE` times
//! together, half as A and half as B, taking turns, each over its own connection. An app that reads
//! "is one left?" and then writes "taken" without holding a lock in between lets both through; one
//! that does it in a single step lets one of them through.
//!
//! Two users, since 5 October 2026 (the owner's decision): with every copy sent as one user, an app
//! that answers a repeat from the person who already holds the seat with "Booked" again, changing
//! nothing, was counted as booking it twenty times. An app's answer cannot tell "taken now" from
//! "already yours", but two different people cannot both have the one thing there was.
