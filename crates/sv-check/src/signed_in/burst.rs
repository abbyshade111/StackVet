//! A burst of creations by one user, held to the number the owner states (V2.4.1).
//!
//! The same shape as the AI feature's limit (C11.2.2): one more than `[policy] requests-per-minute`
//! records are created through `owned` as B, inside a minute. It runs before the password questions,
//! which can change both A's and B's passwords, and waits a minute afterwards so the limit it set
//! off no longer refuses the checks that follow. Each record carries a marker of its own, so none is
//! refused for repeating a value. All of them going through is the finding; the first going
//! through and the last refused the way a limit refuses (429, or 503 with `Retry-After`) is credit
//! for that one action. A refusal of any other kind is not assessed: a token taken once, a quota,
//! or a value kept unique is refused the same way. Without a
//! stated number nothing is judged: a limit kept by a proxy in production is not in the fenced run,
//! so "no limit seen here" alone would accuse apps that have one.
