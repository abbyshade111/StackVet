//! The checks on the sign-in token the app issues itself, when it is a JSON Web Token (a JWT):
//! three parts separated by dots, the first two being JSON that anybody can read and the third a
//! signature over them made with the app's key.
//!
//! Each check sends a token with one thing changed, carried exactly as the real one was and with
//! nothing else, to the private page the sign-in was shown to open. The real token, carried the
//! same way and alone, is sent first as the control: when it does not open the page by itself, the
//! app needs more than the token, a refusal of the changed ones would show nothing, and the checks
//! are not assessed.
//!
//! None of these forges a token the app would have made: that needs the app's key, which `sv`
//! never has. They ask whether the app checks what it should before believing one.
