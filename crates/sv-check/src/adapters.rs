//! Running the language's own security tool, and being honest about when it did not run.
//!
//! Four tree-sitter rules across four languages is a start, not a security review. Every ecosystem
//! already has a tool that knows its own traps — bandit, gosec, brakeman — and the useful thing `sv`
//! can do is run it and read the result, rather than re-implement a hundred rules badly in Rust.
//!
//! Three decisions shape this, and each one is a way of not lying:
//!
//! **A tool that is not installed reports *not run*, and says how to install it.** Never a clean
//! pass. This is the entire reason the adapters are a data file with a `Gap` attached rather than a
//! shell script: a script that skips a missing binary produces a report that looks identical to one
//! where the tool ran and found nothing, and the second is the one everybody assumes.
//!
//! **SARIF and nothing else.** Every tool is asked for SARIF 2.1.0. One output parser that is
//! trusted is worth more than five that are nearly right, and a tool that cannot emit SARIF is not
//! listed yet rather than parsed by guesswork.
//!
//! **The tool's rule ids map to requirements one at a time.** Crediting every requirement a tool
//! knows about to every run of it would make one clean bandit run look like an assessment of Python
//! injection, secrets, weak hashing and debug mode at once. A finding whose rule id is not in the
//! map carries no requirement, which is a fair thing to be and is shown as such.
