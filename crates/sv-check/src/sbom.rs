//! The software bill of materials: what this app actually ships.
//!
//! An SBOM is only worth the completeness of the list. A partial one is more dangerous than none,
//! because the whole point of handing it to somebody is that they can ask "is the compromised version of
//! that library in here?" and trust the answer. So two things are recorded on every component and on the
//! document itself.
//!
//! **Where the version came from.** A lockfile says what is installed. A manifest says what was asked
//! for, and `^4.18.0` is not a version — the thing installed under it changes over time and differs
//! between machines. Components built from a manifest are marked `declared`, and the document says how
//! many of them there are, because "we ship express 4.18.2" and "we asked for some express 4" are
//! different sentences.
//!
//! **What was not read.** An ecosystem whose lockfile format `sv` cannot parse yet is named in the
//! document rather than silently omitted. An SBOM that quietly drops a whole ecosystem reads exactly like
//! one that had nothing to drop.
