//! Four more questions for the running app, from the partial-check review of 28 September 2026
//! (`docs/PARTIAL-CHECKS.md`). Each can show its requirement failing and never settle it, so a
//! clean answer credits nothing and says what was asked.
//!
//! - V10.4.4: the sign-in server's published settings offer the password or implicit grant, which
//!   the requirement says must no longer be used. Which grants each client may use is not published,
//!   so nothing is claimed about that.
//! - V8.4.2: an admin page that is shut to a stranger opens when the request says it came from the
//!   app's own computer (`X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`). Network location is then the only thing
//!   guarding it, which is what the requirement says it must not be.
//! - V13.4.7: files that are in the app's folder and should never be served (settings, keys,
//!   source code, databases, backups) handed back when asked for by name. Judged by the file's own
//!   contents, so a page that answers every address is not mistaken for one.
//! - V16.5.4: the app stopped, restarted, or stopped answering during the questions, so something
//!   it was sent took the whole process down and no last-resort error handler caught it.
