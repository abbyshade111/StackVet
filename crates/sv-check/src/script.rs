//! The run's script: which suites are asked of the running app, in which order, and as whom, once
//! the app is up behind the fence.
//!
//! Until 8 October 2026 this lived in `crates/sv-run/src/docker.rs`, in the middle of the 568-line
//! function that also made the network, started the helpers and the app, and tore it all down, so
//! `sv-run` depended on `sv-check` (the reverse of the stated layering) and the order of the suites
//! could be tried only with Docker. Now the script is here, written against [`Services`]: what the
//! harness alone can do (a way to the app with the helpers it has, the helpers' readiness, the app's
//! log, a second copy of the app with the kill switch on, a seed, a look at whether the app is still
//! up), and nothing about containers. Its tests run it against a fake harness and show the order.
//! The Docker-only residue, the fence, the limits, the install step, the teardown, and the app's own
//! tests inside its container, stays in `sv-run` (the architecture assessment of 8 October 2026,
//! item 4, second half).
