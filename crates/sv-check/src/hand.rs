//! The checks made by hand: a person looked at the app, and says what they saw.
//!
//! Twenty ASVS requirements are left over once the security notes and the design questions have had
//! theirs (`human-checks.json`): the certificate on the live site, whether being away signs you out,
//! whether two people can book the same slot. No check here can make them, so the AI coding tool
//! walks the owner through them (`sv questions`). Until 26 September 2026 what the owner saw was then
//! lost. It is now recorded in the `[checked-by-hand]` section of stackvet.toml, as the owner agreed
//! the same day:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [checked-by-hand]
//! "V12.2.2" = { result = "done", on = "2026-09-26", by = "owner",
//!               how = "Opened the live site; the padlock shows a trusted certificate." }
//! ```
//!
//! # What an answer is worth
//!
//! - **`done` by the owner** is *checked by hand by the owner*: its own tier, just above *attested*,
//!   because the owner watched the app behave rather than describing how it is built, and never
//!   *checked*, which means an automated check looked. It is still the owner's word, which `sv` cannot
//!   repeat, so it stays a test to write where a test could show it and settles no threat.
//! - **`done` by the AI coding tool**, or by nobody named, is *stated by the AI coding tool*, as for
//!   the design questions. So is `by = "owner"` that `sv review` did not record (deep review R1):
//!   the tool can write that line as easily as the owner.
//! - **`problem`** is a finding, from either. Reporting a failure never overstates the app.
//! - **`not-yet`** adds nothing, like `not-sure`.
//!
//! # What keeps it honest
//!
//! - **`how` is required.** One sentence of what was done and seen is the whole of the evidence, and
//!   the report prints it; a bare `done` is reported as unreadable, not counted.
//! - **`on` is required, and a check goes out of date** after [`CURRENT_FOR_DAYS`]. Certificates
//!   expire and apps change; a check older than that is reported as needing to be made again and
//!   counts for nothing. A date in the future is unreadable.
//! - **Only the checks in the list are read.** An id that is not a check by hand is named as
//!   unreadable rather than quietly ignored or quietly credited.
