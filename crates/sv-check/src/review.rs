//! A person's record that a finding is a false alarm, or a risk they accept for now.
//!
//! The owner's decisions, 27 September 2026 (BACKLOG, "False alarms, part 2"). Two verdicts:
//! *false alarm*, the code is fine; *accepted risk*, a real problem lived with for now. Only a
//! person's word counts: the AI coding tool rewrites code until a warning stops, and a switch that
//! makes a warning stop is the easiest rewrite of all, so an entry the tool wrote is shown as its
//! proposal and the finding still counts. Since 4 October 2026 (deep review R1) that means an entry
//! recorded through `sv review`, which seals it (`crate::seal`): `by = "owner"` written into the file
//! by anyone else is a proposal too. A false alarm lapses when the flagged line changes, because
//! the fingerprint it names stops matching; an accepted risk lapses after 90 days; a finding that has
//! no line of code (a running-app probe, a settings check) has nothing to watch, so a false alarm
//! about one lapses after 90 days as well. An entry that does not count is listed with its reason,
//! never dropped quietly.
//!
//! A false alarm leaves the list of things to fix. An accepted risk stays on it, labeled. Neither
//! credits anything: the report sends a requirement whose finding was set aside back to what else is
//! known about it, and never to *checked*.
