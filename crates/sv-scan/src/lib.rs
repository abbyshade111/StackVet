//! The dependency and source scanner: it answers the `derived` conditions, the ones nobody should
//! have to be believed about.
//!
//! The rule that makes an answer here honest is in `evaluate`. A signature match means the
//! condition holds. **No match only means the condition does not hold when every file that could
//! have carried it was actually read.** Several of these technologies are reachable from a standard
//! library with no dependency at all — Python's `xml.etree`, Java's JAXB — so a dependency-only
//! scan answering "no XML parser is used" would be the same class of wrong statement as the
//! inherited v1 reasons this work replaced.
//!
//! Matching is case-insensitive substring. It over-matches rather than under-matches, and an
//! over-match makes a condition *true*, which only ever adds requirements — the same safe direction
//! the manifest claims run in.
