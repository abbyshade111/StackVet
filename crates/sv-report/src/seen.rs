//! `seen.json`: what `sv` saw of the running app, kept beside the report (ADR-082).
//!
//! The report says what `sv` concluded; this says what the conclusions rest on. For each question
//! asked of the running app as somebody not signed in: its id, the method, the path, and what came

//! The probes read their findings and credits from these answers, by the same ids.

//! Everything here is the app's own text, with every credential in it cut down first (`sv-cli`'s
//! `seen` module, which builds this): this crate only holds it and writes it out. It is a report
