//! The short version: what this app's report says, before any of the explaining.
//!
//! The report used to open by explaining its own epistemology — what *checked* means, what it does
//! not mean, why nothing here is a pass — and only then, several hundred words later, get to what
//! was actually found. That order is right for a careful reader and wrong for everybody else. The
//! owner's question is "what should I do about my app", and the answer was on the third screen.
//!
//! # This is the most dangerous section in the report
//!
//! It is also the only one most people will read, which is exactly why it needs the most care. Every
//! honesty rule this project has is easiest to break here, in a summary, where a number sits without
//! the sentence that qualifies it. Three rules hold it:
//!
//! - **No total that reads as a score.** "32 of 218" invites the reader to compute 15% and call it a
//!   grade. The counts are given as a list of what was *done* — something looked, nothing looked —
//!   not as a fraction of an ideal.
//! - **The unexamined majority is stated first among the counts**, because on nearly every real app
//!   it is the largest number and the most important fact. A summary that leads with what was
//!   checked buries it.
//! - **Never the word pass, and never a claim about the app's security.** The report says what was
//!   found and what nobody looked at. `the_short_version_never_says_the_app_is_secure` pins it.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Three things, in the order somebody would do them: fix what was found, answer what only a person
//! can answer, write tests for the rest. Each names where in the report to go.
