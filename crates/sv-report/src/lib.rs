//! The reports: what `sv` found, what it did not look at, and what nobody has answered.
//!
//! Everything else in this workspace prints to a terminal, where a line scrolls past and is gone.
//! A report is kept, sent to somebody, and read by a person who was not there when it ran — which is
//! exactly why it is the most dangerous thing here to get wrong. A terminal line saying "not
//! assessed" that nobody reads costs nothing; the same omission in a document that somebody files as
//! evidence of a security review is how an app ships believing it was checked.
//!
//! Three rules, and every one of them has a test that fails when it is broken:
//!
//! 1. **There is no `pass`.** An applicable requirement is either *needs attention* — a check found
//!    something and cited it — or *checked*, meaning at least one automated check looked at it and was
//!    satisfied, or *not verified*, meaning nothing has produced evidence either way. `Checked` is
//!    deliberately not called a pass: one config check being happy is not an ASVS requirement met,
//!    and the report says so in the words around the number.
//! 2. **Not-verified is counted and printed, not implied.** The reports lead with how much was *not*
//!    examined, because a report that leads with findings reads as thorough in proportion to how
//!    little it looked.
//! 3. **A requirement nobody could even decide the applicability of is its own bucket.** Not
//!    applicable, not failing, not verified: *not assessed*, with the question that would settle it.
