//! What `sv`'s stand-in services received during a run, read from each before its container is
//! removed, for `sv` to keep beside the report (ADR-082, backlog 0229, part 2).
//!
//! The test model keeps what arrived for each message it was sent (the instructions it came with,
//! the tools it was offered, what the app's tools returned) and the addresses fetched through it.
//! The test sign-in provider keeps each request's method, path, and the names of its query
//! parameters, never their values. Of the mail, only who each message was to, its subject, and when
//! it came are kept, never its body, which holds the reset links and codes sent to `sv`'s test
//! accounts; a subject's long numbers and addresses are left out for the same reason.
//!
//! `sv`'s own test secrets (the accounts' passwords and two-factor secrets, the sign-in provider's
//! client secret, the MCP token) are blanked here by value, before anything is parsed, since only
//! this crate knows them; every other credential is cut where the record is written
//! (`sv-cli`'s `seen` module).
