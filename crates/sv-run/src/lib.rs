//! Running the app, so the checks that need a running app have something to check.
//!
//! v1 gets its strongest evidence by running the code: seeded users, DAST probes, a real test
//! suite. Keeping that across arbitrary stacks means the manifest declares how to build, start and
//! test, and `sv` does it inside a fence.
//!
//! # The fence, and what measuring it changed
//!
//! v1 fences a child process with `sandbox-exec` on macOS or a network namespace on Linux, and
//! probes it over `127.0.0.1`. The obvious translation — publish a container port to loopback and
//! probe that — does not work, and this was measured rather than reasoned about:
//!
//! | | `--internal` network | default bridge |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | sidecar on the same network reaches the app | yes | yes |
//! | app can reach 1.1.1.1:53 | **blocked** | succeeded |
//! | host reaches a published port | **no** | yes |
//!
//! An `--internal` network is exactly the fence wanted — no outbound, no DNS — and it is
//! unreachable from the host, published port or not. Moving to a bridge to make host probing work
//! removes the fence altogether. So the probes run from a **sidecar container on the same internal
//! network**, and nothing is published to the host at all.
//!
//! (The first two attempts at that measurement proved nothing: `alpine:3` has no `httpd` applet, so
//! every container exited immediately and reported "outbound blocked" while not running. Then
//! `example.com`'s old address, long decommissioned, made the default bridge look fenced too. The
//! table above comes from a run with a live target and a host baseline confirming outbound is
//! possible from this machine in the first place.)
//!
//! # What happens where there is no backend
//!
//! It reports `not assessed` — never `pass`, never `fail`. A machine without Docker is the normal
//! case for most people running `sv`, and a runner that assumed one would report their apps as
//! failing rather than as unrun. That is the same rule as a scanner that did not run not being a
//! clean result.
