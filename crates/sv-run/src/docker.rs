//! The Docker backend.
//!
//! Shape of a run, and why each step is the way it is:
//!
//! 1. Create a per-run network with `--internal`. Measured: no outbound, no DNS, and unreachable
//!    from this computer. That last part is the reason there is no published port anywhere below.
//! 2. Start the app on it, with its folder mounted read-only and no credentials in its environment.
//! 3. Wait for it to answer its health path — from a **sidecar container on the same network**,
//!    because the host cannot reach it. The sidecar is started once and every request after is an
//!    `exec` into it: a container started per request cost about half a second each, and a
//!    signed-in run makes twenty-odd requests.
//! 4. Ask the probes, anonymous and signed in, through the same sidecar; then remove it.
//! 5. Run the declared test command inside the app container.
//! 6. Tear everything down, whatever happened.
