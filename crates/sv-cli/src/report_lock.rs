//! One run at a time in a report folder, and no older report replacing a newer one.
//!
//! On family-hub (3 October 2026) the owner and their AI coding tool each ran `sv report --run
//! --tools` on the app at about the same time. Both wrote `<app>/stackvet-report`; the AI tool's
//! run succeeded, and the owner's finished two minutes later with a failure and replaced the good
//! report with the failed one, with nothing anywhere to say so (BACKLOG, "What the owner hit
//! building family-hub", item 2). Three things here:
//!
//! - **A lock in the folder** (`LOCK_NAME`), taken before the run starts and let go when it ends. A
//!   second run refuses at once, naming the run that holds the folder: its command, process number,
//!   and when it started. It refuses rather than waits: a run takes minutes, and a command that sits
//!   silent for minutes because of another nobody remembers starting looks stuck.
//! - **A lock a killed run left behind does not block.** The lock is the operating system's own
//!   (`File::try_lock`), which it lets go when the process ends however it ends, `kill -9`
//!   included, so whether the holder is still running is the operating system's answer rather than a
//!   guess from a process number, which can be reused or belong to another machine or container. The
//!   lock file still says who held it, so the next run says that run stopped before it finished.
//! - **A record in `report.json`** (`sv_report::RunRecord`) of when the run started and the hash of
//!   the `stackvet.toml` it read. Before writing, a run reads the report it would replace; if that
//!   one came from a run that started later, it keeps the newer report and says so. With the lock
//!   this happens only where the lock could not hold: a disk without locks, or a run of an `sv` from
//!   before this.
