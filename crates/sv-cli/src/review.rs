//! `sv review`: a person records, in their own terminal, the findings they set aside and the answers
//! they confirm, and `sv` seals each so the AI coding tool's own entries can be told apart (deep
//! review R1; the owner's decision of 4 October 2026, in `sv_check::seal`).
//!
//! It goes through every entry in stackvet.toml that does not yet count on this computer: a
//! `[[finding-review]]` entry and a `confirmed` under `[design]` or `[checked-by-hand]`, whether the
//! AI coding tool proposed it or someone wrote it by hand. For each it shows what is being decided
//! and asks for the person's name. What they record is written back into stackvet.toml, with `by`,
//! today's date and the seal, and nothing else in the file is changed, except one thing: a finding's
//! fingerprint in the form used before 5 October 2026 that names one line is written in today's
//! form, which also watches the lines that set the values that line uses (deep review A2).
//!
//! It refuses to run unless both what it reads and what it writes are a terminal, since an AI coding
//! tool runs commands without one. That stops the easy path, not a tool set on faking a terminal;
//! the seal module says so too.
