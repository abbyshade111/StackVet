//! The backlog is one file per item under `docs/backlog/` (`docs/adr/ADR-061.md`), each with a status line, because
//! every session adding to the end of one file made any two open pull requests conflict there, and what was done was a
//! reading of prose. `tools/backlog.py` reads and writes the status lines; this runs its self-test, its check on the
//! real folder (a misnamed file, a missing title or status, two files with one title, or an item left in
//! `docs/BACKLOG.md` fails it), and its summary, so a layout drift fails here and not in the owner's hands.
