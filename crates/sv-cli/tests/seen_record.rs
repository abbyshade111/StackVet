//! What the running app answered is kept beside the report as `seen.json`, with no credential in it
//! (ADR-082, backlog 0229, part 1).
//!
//! `examples/notes-with-users`, copied, with its home page, the one page a visitor who has not signed in
//! is shown rather than sent to sign in, changed to show a key in its body and a header, and to set a
//! cookie whose value is a session id. Real containers and the real binary.
//! With no container backend, `seen.json` must say nothing was asked, and that is what is checked
//! instead.
